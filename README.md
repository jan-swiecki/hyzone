# Hyzone

Docker orchestration for local/CI environment. Similar to Docker Compose, but imho better.

Currently only Linux with Bash is only supported. After I will install Bash for Windows I'll try to integrate Hyzone with Docker for Windows.

On MAC it should work - I don't have MAC so I cannot verify.
